<p><b>Thurs Dec 24</b></br>
Got the thing home, got it up the stairs to its new home.

<a href="panel_firstpic.JPG"><img src="panel_firstpic.JPG" alt="image of a PDP/8-I frontpanel"></a>
<p>here's what the backplane looks like:</p>
<a href="backplane.JPG"><img src="backplane.JPG" alt="lots o' flip chips"></a>
<p>I've got 8k of core, I think all of the CPU, no EAE or fast paper punch/reader, and half of the teletype interface is missing for some reason</p>
<p>spent some time cleaning out the dust.</p>
<p>then, after it was mostly clean, I took apart the PSU to start reforming these massive caps.</p>
<a href="psu_disassemble.JPG"><img src="psu_disassemble.JPG" alt="partially disassembled PSU"></a>
<p>I'm using a bench supply set to the rated voltage of the cap and current-limited to 20mA, as well as a ~20k resistor in series with each. Taking it nice and slow, probably going to leave it overnight to cook.</p>

<p>also got a TU55 in with the deal, as well as the Pertec Diablo model 30 clone I was <i>supposed</i> to be buying (no good images of that yet); on a whim I put the tape drive up in the rack for a bit.</p>

<p>looks nice, no?</p>

More cleaning done. There was tons of grime on this thing, and whatever it is has something in it that both me and my dad are both allergic to. So I've been more or less tag-teaming with him to get it cleaned up.<br>
It seems to be doing much better by now; it's still bad, but I think I've got a lot of the crap taken off.</p>
<p>The caps finished reforming, so I put the power supply back together, and tested it on a variac, using some small lightbulbs as (small) loads. I didn't get the key along with the machine, so the power switch off an old XT clone will suffice to turn on and off main power. All the voltages checked out fine.</p>
<a href="psu_test.JPG"><img src="psu_test.JPG" alt="psu being tested"></a>
<p>Everything looked OK, so after a good bit of hesitation I cleared all the test leads out of the cabinet, connected everything, and powered it on.</p>
<a href="pwron_tst.JPG"><img src="pwron_tst.JPG" alt"front panel with some lights"></a>
<p>It seems to sort of run and single-step, that is, the program counter and memory address lamps seem to increment through a number of addresses before jumping back to 0000. I can't seem to be able to examine or deposit values in core, but I can use the "LOAD ADD" switch to load values into the PC.</p>  
<p>I also took the time to get the boards for a flip-chip tester on order, and I'm working on ordering a bunch of 74-series logic for the boards, and small lightbulbs for the frontpanel.</p>

I've been mostly cleaning on the machine while I wait for the parts for the flip chip tester to arrive. I've powered it on a few times, and I can already tell that most of the front panel lamps are dead, and will need replacing. They're on order from DigiKey along with the tester parts; I'll be able to know more once those are replaced.</p>
<p>until then, I've started taking each chip out, one at a time, cleaning them, and then putting them back. I've noticed that most of the chips have date codes around the 10-20'th week of '69, while the chassis has '12-23-68' written on it in large characters.</p>
