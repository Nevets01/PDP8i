Got the thing home, got it up the stairs to its new home.

<p>here's what the backplane looks like:</p>
<a href="backplane.JPG"><img src="backplane.JPG" alt="lots o' flip chips"></a>
<p>I've got 8k of core, I think all of the CPU, no EAE or fast paper punch/reader, and half of the teletype interface is missing for some reason</p>
<p>spent some time cleaning out the dust</p>
<p>then took apart the PSU to start reforming these massive caps. </p>

<p>I'm using a bench supply set to the rated voltage of the cap and current-limited to 20mA, as well as a ~20k resistor in series with each. Taking it nice and slow, probably going to leave it overnight to cook.</p>
